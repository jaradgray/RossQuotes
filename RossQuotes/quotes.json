        "We don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents.",
        "Talent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.",
        "There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.",
        "I guess I’m a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That’s okay though; I have more fun than most people.",
        "Let's get crazy.",
        "I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.",
        "Beat the devil out of it.",
        "I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.",
        "You have unlimited power on this canvas.",
        "Lets build a happy little cloud. Lets build some happy little trees.",
        "This is your world.",
        "I like to beat the brush.",
        "In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers.",
        "You need the dark in order to show the light.",
        "Look around. Look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere - you only have to look to see it.",
        "Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.",
        "The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.",
        "I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush."
